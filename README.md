## How to Stake your Martian NFT to earn $MARS tokens

### What is Staking?

Staking means that you "lock" your NFT in a "smart contract" on Solana blockchain. It still remains under your control and you can "unlock" your NFT at any time. In exchange for locking your NFT, you get to earn the project's native token, `$MARS`, which can be used in the Martian ecosystem.

#### Your rewards for staking start with our Genesis Spaceship.

Stake your Martian NFT in the Spaceship to earn `162 $MARS` per day. You will also be able to buy your own Spaceship in the future and run your own staking machine. Having a private Spaceship means you can earn higher yield for your own Martians, and you'll also be able to rent bunk space to other Martians and split your earnings.

#### To stake your NFT;

- :white_check_mark: Visit our [Genesis spaceship](https://ship.martianarmy.space/)
- :white_check_mark: Connect your wallet that has your MartianArmy NFT
- :white_check_mark: Select the NFT, you will like to stake

Congratulations!!! You can now start earning `$MARS` tokens ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
